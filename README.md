# Pre-work - *Memory Game*

**Memory Game** is a Light & Sound Memory game to apply for CodePath's SITE Program. 

Submitted by: **EMANUEL WARZEL**

Time spent: **4** hours spent in total

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [x] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [x] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [x] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [x] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [x] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [x] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [ ] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [ ] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [ ] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [ ] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 

I used W3 Schools to see the complete color palette available in CSS by keyword.

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 

I have some programming experience with Java from classes that I have and am currently taking at college. Despite this, I struggled with the logic set forth in the pre-work on keeping track of how much progress the user has made. We have multiple actions going on such as lighting up more buttons on the next pattern. We also need to keep track of how many guesses have been revealed so far. The prework was a step-by-step instruction sheet that explained the activity from beginning to end, but I needed to really sit down and see if I understood what was presented to me. Personally, I used this project to brush up on my web development skills, learn about Java, but also reflect on my programming flow. To increase clarity of understanding the project and organize my thoughts, I created a flowchart. This is something I do now before every programming project so I can see and plan first. In the past I would go back and forth with ideas and features as needed and be all over the place. What needs to happen instead is a skeleton structure laying the foundation. The base logic needs to be there, and the rest of the features can be added as we go along.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

I've done work with MySQL databases in the past and was able to pull data using PHP. Having refreshed some web development knowledge, I would be excited to learn more about working with databases. For the light and sound game you could have user registration and login to save scores. Ideas that I have heard about but never implemented like hashing and salting is something I want to work on. Net coding interactions between two users in real time would be another. Two users could be competing in the game and the scores are compared at the end to determine a winner.

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

Unfortunately while working on this project I got caught up with a lot of end-of-semester projects and didn’t have time to add optional features. Some things I was planning to add were confetti when the user wins using CSS. Randomizing the pattern presented to the user and adding lives to keep playing on incorrect guesses are optional ideas I wish I took advantage of. In terms of refactoring, I could definitely clean up the Javascript and add comments as best practice in general. You don’t just program, but you need to organize the order of things by hierarchy and purpose. Sectioning out all button functionality and sectioning out all the code functionality is an example.
